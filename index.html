    <p>I am loving this class. It's starting slow, 
        but I feel like it's going to get a lot harder soon. 
        I have been going through the lessons on <a href="learnprogramming.online">learnprogramming.online</a> and I love how it makes me feel smart! It takes one thing at a time, teaching little by little. I just finished lesson 5.</p>
